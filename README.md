# Hello_World
Getting Started

Getting Started,

All of this is really interseting thus far. I am currently in pursuit of my Computer Science degree, projected graduation date is December of 2018. I have gone over Java, C++, SQL, and Python through my course curriculum. I am here to expand my knowledge on programming, and to polish existing skills. If anyone has any small intro programs that would help.
